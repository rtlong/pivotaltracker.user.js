# pivotaltracker.user.js

This is a Userscript for adding some extra minor functionality to the Pivotal Tracker UI.

At the moment, all it does is:

  - toggle visibility of story labels upon pressing 'L' key

## To install

To install in Chrome, download the pivotaltracker.user.js file from this repo, then open
your Chrome extensions page (`chrome://extensions`), then drag the downloaded user script
up from the downloads bar (or your file manager) into that extensions page. This is
clunky, yes, but it's the only way Chrome lets one install userscripts. I'd accept any
help turning this into a proper extension so this process is smoother.
